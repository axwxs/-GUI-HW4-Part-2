# GUI-HW4-Part-2

## Description
* A dynamic multiplication table generator that is valid for numbers between -50 and 50. Pretty much the same as HW3 but this one uses the jQuery validation plugin for validating input instead of vanilla Javascript. This version includes jQuery UI for use of tabs and sliders.
